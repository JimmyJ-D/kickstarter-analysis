# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise  has commission a data analysis of play fundraising goals. She would like to know the different and funding success based on launch dates and funding goals. 


## Analysis and Challenges
Using the provided  "Kickstart" dataset I was able to provide filter data based on the category theater.  The sample of information was taken from years 2009 - 2017. While the eight years of date provided 1369 theater funding projects to gather data, a larger sample window of years could have provided additional data points. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the provided data and graph on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Data" worksheet, out of 1393 theater fund raising campaigns the best months to start are May and June. May and June had the best successful funding campaigns, followed closely by July.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data provided on "Outcomes Based on Goals" worksheet shows that the most successful funding project had goals of lest that $1000. Projects with funding goals of less than $1000 had a 76% success rate and projects with a funding goal of $1000 to $4999 had a 73% success of reaching their goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Project funding amounts under $5000 have an over 73% successful rate of funding. Funding campaigns greater than $50000 presented as an outlier with 100% successful funding on two campaigns. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May and June are the two most successful months for starting funding campaigns. 
The least successful month to start a funding campaign is December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise will have at least a 73% chance of funding her cause if she keeps here funding goal under $9999. If she need a larger amount for her play she can raise her funding goal to at least $19999 and expect at maximal a 50% success rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
This dataset is tailored for theaters fund raising and only cover eight years for data

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could also used stacked column charts. The stack column chart would offer a visual of successful, failed and total number of campaigns in the same bar the x-axis.
